Scope: project/claude-sdk-sidecar
Completion: VIABLE but NOT RECOMMENDED | Gaps: 0 (clear decision) | Test Quality: N/A
Reused: 1 RECENT finding (claude-sdk-integration.md) | Fresh: 9+ plugin analyses
Cache updated: [obsidian-subprocess-patterns.md] in eval-cache/
Ambiguities: 0 (clear technical decision) | Workflow: CONTINUE with Option 3 (MCP Server)
Decision: Sidecar approach is viable but inferior to MCP server pattern
Next: Implement MCP server WebSocket transport (10-15 hours) OR validate SDK if needed (3-4 hours)

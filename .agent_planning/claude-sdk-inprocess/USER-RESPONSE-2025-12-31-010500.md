## User Feedback

Approved, but with important context:

> "Considering many other plugins run subprocesses, I don't want you to abandon it at the first speedbump"

## Interpretation

- Many Obsidian plugins successfully spawn subprocesses (Git, Pandoc, etc.)
- Electron CAN spawn subprocesses via Node.js `child_process`
- Don't abandon at first error - investigate and troubleshoot
- The 60% failure probability was overly pessimistic
- Try both in-process MCP AND subprocess approaches if needed

## Adjusted Approach

1. Try in-process `createSdkMcpServer()` first (cleanest)
2. If that requires subprocess, **that's fine** - use subprocess approach
3. Only abandon if fundamentally incompatible with Obsidian distribution
4. Be persistent - debug issues rather than giving up

## Decision

PROCEED with validation, but with persistence mindset rather than "fail fast" mindset.

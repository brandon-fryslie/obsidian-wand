# Sprint Plan: User-Facing Documentation

Generated: 2025-12-16-164500

## Sprint Goal

Create user-facing documentation in docs/ directory: ARCHITECTURE.md and PROJECT_SPEC.md adapted from internal planning docs.

## Scope

**In scope (this sprint):**
1. docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - System design overview for contributors/users
2. docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md - Comprehensive project specification
3. docs/TOOLS.md - Tool reference with examples (bonus if time)

**Explicitly out of scope:**
- CHANGELOG.md (user doesn't care)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (user barely cares)
- DEVELOPMENT.md (can add later if needed)

## Work Items

### P0: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md

Adapt .agent_planning/ARCHITECTURE.md (40KB) into a user-friendly version.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] File exists at docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Contains system overview diagram (ASCII)
- [ ] Explains three-phase workflow (Plan → Confirm → Execute)
- [ ] Documents all major components with purpose
- [ ] Includes data flow example
- [ ] Readable by someone unfamiliar with the codebase

**Technical Notes:**
- Simplify from 1500+ lines to ~300-500 lines
- Remove internal implementation details
- Focus on "what" and "why", less on "how"

### P1: docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md

Adapt .agent_planning/PROJECT_SPEC.md (29KB) into user-facing spec.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] File exists at docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md
- [ ] Contains project overview and goals
- [ ] Documents all tools with their schemas
- [ ] Explains ActionPlan JSON format
- [ ] Includes safety model and constraints
- [ ] Readable by someone evaluating the project

**Technical Notes:**
- Consolidate from PROJECT_SPEC/ reference materials
- Include tool schemas in human-readable format
- Document the LLM interaction model

### P2: docs/TOOLS.md (bonus)

Tool reference with examples.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] File exists at docs/TOOLS.md
- [ ] Lists all tools by category (vault, editor, workspace, commands, util)
- [ ] Each tool has: description, input schema, output schema, example
- [ ] Includes common usage patterns

## Dependencies

- Existing .agent_planning/ARCHITECTURE.md
- Existing .agent_planning/PROJECT_SPEC.md
- PROJECT_SPEC/ reference materials

## Risks

- None significant - straightforward documentation adaptation

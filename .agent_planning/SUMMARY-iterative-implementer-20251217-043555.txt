Implementation Summary:
- Created ExecutionManager service (src/services/ExecutionManager.ts)
  - High-level orchestration layer for plan execution
  - Manages execution lifecycle: execute, pause, resume, cancel
  - Real-time progress tracking via event subscription
  - Integrates with existing Executor and PlanStore services

- Created ExecutionOverlay component (src/components/ExecutionOverlay.svelte)
  - Full-screen overlay during execution
  - Real-time progress bar and step-by-step log
  - Pause and cancel controls
  - Visual indicators for running/paused/error states

- Updated PlanView (src/views/PlanView.ts)
  - Subscribes to execution progress events
  - Handles all execution actions (execute, pause, resume, cancel, retry)
  - Updates UI dynamically during execution
  - Clears progress state on completion

- Updated PlanPanel (src/components/PlanPanel.svelte)
  - Receives execution progress as prop
  - Displays ExecutionOverlay when executing
  - Forwards pause/cancel actions to parent

- Updated PluginServices (src/services/PluginServices.ts)
  - Added ExecutionManager to service container
  - Initialized in correct dependency order

All Phase 6 acceptance criteria met:
✓ ExecutionManager executes plans step-by-step
✓ Progress updates in real-time
✓ Pause stops execution at current step
✓ Resume continues from paused step
✓ Cancel aborts execution cleanly
✓ Failed plans can be retried

=== Implementation Summary ===

Phase 1: Core Data Model - COMPLETE

Created three TypeScript type definition files for the plan management interface:

1. src/types/Plan.ts
   - Plan interface with complete lifecycle fields
   - PlanStatus type (8 states: draft, pending, approved, executing, paused, completed, failed, cancelled)
   - ExecutionState interface for tracking current execution
   - ExecutionAttempt interface for execution history
   - PlanDraft interface for creation workflow
   - Full integration with existing ActionPlan and PlanSummary types

2. src/types/PlanEvents.ts
   - PlanEvent discriminated union for reactive updates
   - 7 event types: created, updated, status-changed, execution-started, execution-progress, execution-completed, deleted
   - Type guard helper function (isPlanEvent)
   - Timestamp on all events

3. src/types/PlanFilters.ts
   - PlanFilters interface with comprehensive query support
   - Support for status, tags, search, date range, priority filtering
   - Sorting by createdAt, updatedAt, priority, title, or status
   - DEFAULT_PLAN_FILTERS constant
   - PLAN_FILTER_PRESETS for common views (all, pending, executing, completed, failed, pinned)

=== Validation ===

Build Status: PASS
- pnpm run build completed successfully
- No type errors
- Only pre-existing warnings in unrelated components

=== All Acceptance Criteria Met ===

✓ Plan interface defined with all lifecycle fields
✓ PlanStatus type covers all states (8 states defined)
✓ ExecutionAttempt tracks run history with timestamps and results
✓ PlanEvent types enable reactive UI updates (7 event types)
✓ PlanFilters interface supports querying by status, tags, search, date, priority

=== Next Steps ===

Phase 2: Plan Store Service
- Implement PlanStore class with CRUD operations
- Add filtering and lifecycle methods
- Implement event subscription system
- Add persistence layer (save/load from disk)
- Create Svelte store wrappers for reactive UI

=== Files Modified ===

New Files:
- src/types/Plan.ts
- src/types/PlanEvents.ts
- src/types/PlanFilters.ts
- .agent_planning/tool-interface/DOD-20251217-105500.md
- .agent_planning/tool-interface/PLAN-20251217-105500.md

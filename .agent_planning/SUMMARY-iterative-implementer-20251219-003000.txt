=== Implementation Summary ===

Successfully implemented Advanced Tables plugin integration following the established patterns from DataviewService, TemplaterService, and TasksService.

=== Files Created ===
1. src/services/AdvancedTablesService.ts (280 lines)
   - Service class for Advanced Tables plugin integration
   - Command execution via Obsidian's command system
   - Support for all major table operations

2. e2e/advancedtables.spec.ts (179 lines)
   - E2E tests for Advanced Tables integration
   - Tests plugin detection and graceful degradation

=== Files Modified ===
1. src/types/ActionPlan.ts
   - Added 6 Advanced Tables tool names to ToolName union

2. src/schemas/toolSchemas.ts
   - Added 12 Zod schemas (6 input + 6 output)
   - Registered all 6 tools in TOOL_SCHEMAS registry

3. src/services/ToolsLayer.ts
   - Imported AdvancedTablesService
   - Added 6 tool method implementations
   - Added switch cases for all 6 tools

4. src/services/PlanGenerator.ts
   - Added Advanced Tables documentation to system prompt
   - Included usage examples and best practices

=== Tools Implemented ===
1. advancedtables.status - Check plugin availability
2. advancedtables.format - Format table(s)
3. advancedtables.insertRow - Insert row before current
4. advancedtables.insertColumn - Insert column before current
5. advancedtables.sort - Sort by current column (asc/desc)
6. advancedtables.align - Set column alignment (left/center/right)

=== Build Status ===
- TypeScript compilation: PASSED
- Build output: SUCCESS (2 pre-existing warnings)
- All new code follows established patterns

=== Git Commits ===
1. 3c7b90f - feat(advancedtables): add AdvancedTablesService with command execution

=== Next Steps ===
None - Advanced Tables integration is complete and ready for use.

=== Notes ===
- Advanced Tables has NO public API, so we execute commands via Obsidian's command system
- Most operations require cursor to be inside a table
- Graceful fallback when plugin is not installed (returns available: false)
- Follows exact patterns from Tasks, Templater, and Dataview integrations

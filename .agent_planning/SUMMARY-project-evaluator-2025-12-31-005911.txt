CRITICAL BLOCKER: Unknown if SDK requires Claude Code subprocess even with in-process MCP servers.
Evidence suggests "in-process" means no subprocess, but SDK has extensive subprocess infrastructure.
MUST TEST with minimal POC before any implementation work.

RECOMMENDATION: Run Phase 1 POC (30 min smoke test) to validate core assumption.
If subprocess required → STOP, enhance WandWithThinkingAgent instead.
If subprocess NOT required → Proceed with full integration.

ASSETS READY:
- SDK installed (v0.1.76)
- createSdkMcpServer() exists
- ObsidianMCPServer.ts has 40+ tools in correct format
- WandWithThinkingAgent provides working fallback

RISKS:
1. Subprocess requirement (60% probability, kills approach)
2. Electron incompatibility (30% probability, blocks SDK)
3. Bundle size explosion (50% probability, distribution issue)

NEXT: 3-hour validation window to prove/disprove viability before major time investment.

Scope: project/docs
Completion: 60% | Gaps: 3 critical | Doc Quality: HIGH (existing)
Reused: 0 findings | Fresh: 12 findings
Cache updated: [none - doc evaluation doesn't benefit from caching]
Ambiguities: 4 found (all resolved with recommendations)
Workflow: CONTINUE
Next: Create docs/DEVELOPMENT.md, docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md

Key Findings:
- README.md: EXCELLENT (production-ready, 201 lines)
- .agent_planning/: EXCELLENT (2500+ lines comprehensive specs)
- docs/: EMPTY (critical gap for contributors)
- PROJECT_SPEC/: EXCELLENT (1779 lines reference specs)
- agent-algorithm.md: EMPTY (0 bytes, needs fill or remove)

Recommendations:
1. [HIGH] Create docs/DEVELOPMENT.md (extract from PROJECT_SPEC.md)
2. [HIGH] Create docs/CONTRIBUTING.md (standard guidelines)
3. [HIGH] Create CHANGELOG.md (required for Obsidian community)
4. [HIGH] Fill or remove agent-algorithm.md (empty file)
5. [MED] Create docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (simplify from .agent_planning/)
6. [MED] Create docs/TOOLS.md (adapt tool conventions)
7. [MED] Create docs/SECURITY.md (extract security section)

Strategy: Adapt (not copy) .agent_planning/ docs for user-facing docs/
- .agent_planning/: Comprehensive, agent-focused (keep as-is)
- docs/: Simplified, contributor-focused (create new)
- PROJECT_SPEC/: Original specs (reference material)
- Root: User docs (README.md is excellent)

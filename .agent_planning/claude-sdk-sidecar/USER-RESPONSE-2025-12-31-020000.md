## User Feedback

> "Yes approved, but this is a different use case entirely and isn't an alternative to the first 2. we can still explore it tho"

## Clarification

This is NOT an alternative to Options 1 or 2. These are THREE separate features:

| Option | Architecture | Use Case |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Option 1: In-process SDK | SDK runs inside plugin, MCP tools in-process | Users who want Claude Code capabilities within Obsidian UI |
| Option 2: Sidecar | Plugin spawns Claude Code as subprocess | Users who want Claude Code capabilities within Obsidian UI (alternative impl) |
| Option 3: MCP Server | External Claude Code connects to plugin | Users who already use Claude Code CLI and want Obsidian tools added |

Options 1 & 2 are alternative implementations of the same goal.
Option 3 serves a different user need entirely.

## Decision

APPROVED - add to roadmap as a separate feature track, not as a replacement for Options 1/2.

All three can coexist and serve different user preferences.
